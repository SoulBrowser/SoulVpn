ADAM GLAZIER: Hi,
I'm Adam Glazier,

3
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.359
a UX designer on the
Google Cast team.

4
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.600
If you're new to
Cast, Cast is a way

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.290
for people to get content
from your app to their TV.

6
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.790
And in this video,
I'll show you why

7
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.879
Cast works the way
it does so that you

8
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.920
can be informed while
designing your app.

9
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.950
Now for the sake of
simplicity, the examples

10
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.280
I'll share focus on casting
and controlling video.

11
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.200
However, it's worth
noting that you can also

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.040
cast other types of media, such
as music, games, and photos.

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.930
Now, when designing
for Cast, there

14
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.360
are three main
things to consider.

15
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.269
Your app is the remote.

16
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.420
So just like a TV
remote, your app

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
should make it easy for anyone
to control a cast at any time.

18
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.489
People need instant
control no matter

19
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.010
what state their device is in.

20
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.540
Second, it's a
shared experience.

21
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.450
When your app is casting, expect
that others are in the room.

22
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.840
Some will be watching.

23
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.380
Some will contribute.

24
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.080
And some will need
to take control.

25
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.350
Third is that it's
cross platform.

26
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.510
The living room has
many devices in it,

27
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.020
and the more devices that
can control your cast,

28
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.780
the more seamless it will feel.

29
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.850
Now because casting's
a new action,

30
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.570
its usage depends
on people being

31
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.960
reminded that it's available.

32
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.729
An easy way to do this is
to show a one time cast

33
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.430
introduction screen.

34
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.400
This intro will help
users new to casting

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880
and also help
experienced users know

36
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.369
that your app is
now cast enabled.

37
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.670
So placing the cast
icon at the top right

38
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.050
of every screen in
your app will allow

39
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.880
users to start and
control casts at any time.

40
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.479
And to be clear, the
cast icon should always

41
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.620
be visible whenever a cast
receiver is available.

42
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.670
Now, once users
are ready to cast,

43
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.220
they can do that in two ways.

44
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.920
They can connect to a cast
receiver and then play content,

45
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.070
or they can start
playing content

46
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.619
and then connect to a receiver.

47
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.730
Either way they start, cast
is the mode of the app.

48
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.440
So just like Bluetooth,
once you're connected,

49
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.490
whatever you play in the
app should cast to the TV.

50
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.940
Now once content starts
streaming to the TV,

51
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.060
the phone allows users
to browse and control

52
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.720
casts while the TV displays
the streaming content.

53
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.420
Now, when designing
your TV UI, do not

54
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.160
make it look touchable or
simply reuse the tablet UI.

55
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.609
For example, in
research I've observed,

56
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.140
people attempted to use
the physical TV remote

57
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.559
when the UI on the TV
looked interactive.

58
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.840
So with this in mind, when
you tap pause on the phone,

59
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.490
it changes to a play icon and
the TV shows to pause icon.

60
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.420
This is because the
TV's showing the state

61
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.359
and the phone is
providing the action.

62
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.530
The second tip is to help the
TV UI stay out of the way.

63
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.380
For instance, people
will sometimes

64
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.280
pause a video to examine
a frame or read text

65
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.870
on the screen like
closed captions.

66
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.190
So when someone pauses a
video, fade the TV UI away

67
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.570
after five seconds.

68
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.140
Keeping the UI within the
lower fourth of the TV

69
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.459
will also help since most
of the important content

70
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.090
is typically above that.

71
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.070
The last tip is to
provide the ability

72
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.739
to control a cast from
every state of your app.

73
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.850
At any given time, the most
critical controls for people

74
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.570
are play and pause and volume.

75
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.359
Remember, this is
super important,

76
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.290
because your app is the
only remote they have.

77
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.420
Now, on Android, there's five
places to surface controls.

78
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.950
You can provide a full set
of controls in your app

79
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.630
for the content
currently playing

80
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.769
and when navigating
elsewhere in your app,

81
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.640
provide a persisting controller.

82
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.470
This is commonly a control bar
at the bottom of every screen.

83
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.280
Also, provide controls
within the cast menu,

84
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.570
because this is where users
start and stop casting.

85
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.640
And when users
exit your app, make

86
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.660
sure to provide controls
and notifications

87
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.450
in the lock screen.

88
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.260
Doing all of these together
will ensure the most seamless

89
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.600
experience so that your
users can relax and use

90
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.620
their phone however they like.

91
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.205
Now, once something's
casting, expect

92
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.440
that more users will
want to join in.

93
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.750
So at a minimum, when
multiple users are connected,

94
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.010
each user should be
able to take control.

95
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.750
An example of this
is that if you

96
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.540
left the room while
casting, your friend

97
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.640
should be able to take control.

98
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.469
Another possibility is that you
started a cast and your friends

99
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.460
want to add to the queue.

100
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.030
So designing your app to
work for anyone at any time

101
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.789
will help it feel extra natural.

102
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.510
Now, from time to time, expect
that the phone's connection

103
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.340
to a cast may go in and out.

104
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.820
This can happen from the
Wi-Fi going out of range,

105
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.510
the phone battery dying, or
your app's processes being

106
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.010
stopped by another app.

107
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.610
When this happens,
automatically reconnect

108
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.990
users that dropped off
whenever they're in your app.

109
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.970
The final step to a
cast is disconnecting.

110
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.790
Users can disconnect
from the cast menu

111
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.680
and also from a
notification in Android.

112
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.180
Now, to prevent users from
accidentally stopping a cast,

113
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.310
make sure to only
stop the cast when

114
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.600
the last connected
user disconnects.

115
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.040
For the complete set
of cast UX guidelines,

116
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.820
don't forget to check out the
design checklist on the cast

117
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.440
SDK site.

118
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.810
Thanks for watching, and
I'll see you next time.

119
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.042
